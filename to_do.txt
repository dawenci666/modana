to do:
-multi dim
-noise as diff generators: loook into cpu freq utc time etc, maybe instruction cycle?
-generalize distrubitions 
-fix edge length issue - look into diff lib called graphviz???
-on topology side look into more convoluted connections and self changing networks
-simul side
--add coupling? -  one opinion changes another
--confidence/trust/cynicism - direct correlation to persuasiveness
--stubborn -  wont change for anything or anyone
--what about epiphany (rand bit flips)
--self adding and severing ties
--multiple agent reacting as grps
--external media influence
--pretending??
