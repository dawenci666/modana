Realistic Opinion-Driven Edge Weight Dynamics (Edge weight + Opinions only)
Core principles:

    Tie Strength Reflects Relationship Intensity
    Edge weight = strength of social tie; stronger ties mean more frequent contact, trust, influence.

    Homophily Reinforces Ties
    When opinions are similar, the tie strengthens (people bond more).

    Disagreement Weakens Ties
    Sustained opinion differences gradually weaken the relationship.

    Tie Decay and Maintenance
    Even if opinions stay stable, ties decay slowly over time without “interaction” (modeled implicitly).

    New Ties Form Based on Opinion Proximity
    Agents probabilistically form new connections to similar others.

Update Logic (Per time step for each edge (i,j)(i,j)):

    Compute opinion difference:
    d=∣oi−oj∣
    d=∣oi​−oj​∣

    Tie reinforcement (if similar):
    If d≤τd≤τ (similar opinions threshold),
    wt+1=wt+r×(1−d)×(1−wt)
    wt+1​=wt​+r×(1−d)×(1−wt​)

    where:

        rr is a reinforcement rate (small, e.g., 0.05)

        (1−d)(1−d) scales reinforcement by closeness

        (1−wt)(1−wt​) limits growth as weight approaches max (1)

    Tie weakening (if dissimilar):
    If d>τd>τ,
    wt+1=wt−s×d×wt
    wt+1​=wt​−s×d×wt​

    where:

        ss is a weakening rate (small, e.g., 0.03)

        dd scales weakening by opinion difference

        wtwt​ means stronger ties weaken more slowly (inertia)

    Baseline decay (tie forgetting):
    Regardless of opinions, apply slow decay to model fading without active reinforcement:
    wt+1=wt+1×(1−δ)
    wt+1​=wt+1​×(1−δ)

    where δδ is a small decay rate (e.g., 0.01)

    New tie formation (if no edge exists):
    Probability to form new tie between i,ji,j based on opinion similarity:
    Padd=exp⁡(−κ×d)
    Padd​=exp(−κ×d)

    With chance PaddPadd​, set:
    wt+1=winit
    wt+1​=winit​

    where winitwinit​ is initial tie strength (e.g., 0.3)

    Edge removal:
    If wt+1wt+1​ falls below a threshold wminwmin​ (e.g., 0.05), remove the edge.

Why this is realistic?

    Non-linear strengthening slows as ties get stronger — mirrors relationship saturation.

    Weakening depends on opinion gap and current strength, capturing resilience of strong ties.

    Baseline decay models natural forgetting if ties are not reinforced.

    Tie formation probability falls off exponentially with opinion difference, matching homophily and exploration.

    Tie removal threshold mimics social tie “death.”

Social interpretation:

    Friends with similar views grow closer, reinforcing bonds.

    Disagreement weakens relationships but strong bonds resist quick decay.

    Relationships fade slowly without interaction, even if opinions stay aligned.

    New social ties form preferentially with like-minded individuals but some randomness remains.

    Network topology and tie strengths evolve smoothly over time, allowing clusters, bridges, and gradual shifts — very close to real social dynamics.
